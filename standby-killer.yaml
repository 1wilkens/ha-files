  description:
    This is a blueprint to turn off a smart plug after the power draw has
    been low for a certain time. Itâ€™s useful for devices that draw significant power
    in standby, like PCs.
  domain: automation
  input:
    power_sensor:
      name: Power Sensor
      description:
        Sensor for power usage to determine if device(s) are 'on' or 'standby'.
      selector:
        entity:
          filter:
            domain: sensor
            device_class: power
          multiple: false

    power_threshold:
      name: Power Threshold (Watts)
      description:
        Power threshold in Watts to determine device state. Power usage above the
        threshold indicates 'on' and below indicates 'standby'.
      default: 10

    off_timeout:
      name: Standby Timeout (Minutes)
      description:
        The timeout in minutes after which the device(s) should be turned off. 
      default: 15
      selector:
        number:
          unit_of_measurement: minutes
          mode: slider

          max: 60.0
          step: 1.0

    smart_plug:
      name: Smart Plug
      description:
        The smart plug that should be turned off after standby is detected for the
        configured timeout.
      selector:
        entity:
          filter:
            domain: switch
